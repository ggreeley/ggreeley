### Hi there!

My name is Garrett Greeley. I'm currently Postdoctoral Associate at Stony Brook University, working remotely from Texas (Waco area). I'm interested in researching retrieval dynamics, collective memory, false memory, and how remembering influences subsequent learning - all in social contexts. In addition to research, I've completed coursework on a range of topics, focusing on cognition and quantitative methods/statistics.

I'm a frequent R user, using it (and a variety of packages) for wrangling, analysis, and visualization for academic and personal projects. I'm also diving into Python, focusing on its data science and machine learning applications. Finally, I occasionally tinker with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for experiment development.
