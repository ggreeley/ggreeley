### Hi there!

My name is Garrett Greeley. I'm currently a 3rd Year Ph.D. Student at Stony Brook University in the Cognitive Science area. I'm interested in researching collective memory, retrieval organization, and how memory influences subsequent learning - all in social contexts. In addition to research, I'm completing coursework on a range of topics, focusing on cognition and quantitative methods/statistics.

I'm a frequent R user, using it (and a variety of packages) for wrangling, analysis, and visualization for academic and personal projects. I'm also diving into Python, focusing on its data science and machine learning applications. Finally, I occasionally tinker with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for experiment development.
